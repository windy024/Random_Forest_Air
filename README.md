## DATA DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.

The flight delay and cancellation data was collected and published by the DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to build a random forest algorithm to predict the delay of flights.
